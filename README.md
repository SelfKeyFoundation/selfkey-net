# Overview

SelfKey.NET is the SelfKey platform to support our partners using .NET including .NET Core, .NET Standard and ASP.NET Core 2.2.

 * **SelfKey.Login.Api** is a .NET Standard API for .NET client applications to leverage Login with SelfKey capabilities.
 * **SelfKey.Login.Data** is a class library containing the models required for transmitting data for use with Login with SelfKey.

## SelfKey.Login.Api

 * This module provides a single static class (`Authenticator`) for signing and verifying messages using [Nethereum](https://nethereum.com/).  It may be added as a dependency to any .NET project supporting [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) 2.0.
 * Call `Sign` to sign a message.  You may pass a private key as a string or an `EthECKey` object.  The method will return a signature that can be used to verify the message later.
 * Call `Verify` to verify a message using a passed [`User`](SelfKey.Login.Data/Models/User.Entity.cs) object.  It will verify that the recovered public key matches the address provided in the `User` object.
 
## SelfKey.Login.Data

 * This module provides a set of model entity classes based on a JSON schema to be used for transmitting data.  It may be added as a dependency to any .NET project supporting [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) 2.0.
 * The JSON schema is included as [login-schema.json](SelfKey.Login.Data/login-schema.json) which describes a payload that can be used for any RESTful web API intended to receive Login with SelfKey data.
 * The model entity classes (in [LoginClasses.cs](SelfKey.Login.Data/Models/LoginClasses.cs)) are automatically generated by the [NSwag](https://github.com/RSuter/NSwag) toolchain during the build (if they are out of date).  This uses [nswag.json](SelfKey.Login.Data/nswag.json) which was generated using [NSwagStudio](https://github.com/RSuter/NSwag/wiki/NSwagStudio) and can be updated using this application if ever required.
